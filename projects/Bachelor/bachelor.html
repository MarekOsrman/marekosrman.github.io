		Assistive Software for Colorblind People
	  </h1>
	  <p>
		The goal of this project is to create a tool for converting a color scene to a new, different scene with the color spectrum suitable for the needs of the people with diverse disabilities in the color perception. This way, the work can bring in closer the ways of perceiving the world by people with sight disabilities to the common population with normal color vision.
		To solve this task, it is important to familiarize with the color percieving disabilities, to analyze the solutions used in existing software and to study the methods of converting colors between the different color spaces. Consequently, to choose and to implement suitable color conversions for each of the color perceiving defects and to test the chosen method and to evaluate the recieved results.
